# Real Adapter

TODO: Start here!

In the last exercise we essentially set up an `ArrayAdapter`, but without the nice view recycling properties. Let's fix that by setting up a real `ArrayAdapter` and `ListView`. 

# The Exercise

First complete `EarthquakeAdapter`, then follow the TODOs in `EarthquakeActivity` to use a `EarthquakeAdapter` to turn our list of earthquakes into a nice `ListView`.
