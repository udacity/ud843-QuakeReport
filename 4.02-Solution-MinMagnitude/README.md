# Min Magnitude Setting

TODO: Start here!

# The Exercise

First check out the XML we added in `settings_main.xml` to specify what sort of preference the minimum magnitude should be, and note the strings we added to `strings.xml`. Then in `QueryUtils.getParamMap()` it's up to you to query the system's `SharedPreferences` for the desired minimum magnitude, and add it to the URL parameters!

Check out the TODOs to get started!
