# Quake Report Student Exercises

Welcome to the code supporting the Beginning Android Networking course, part of the Beginning Android Nanodegree at Udacity!

This course follows the development of an app called Quake Report, which displays info on recent earthquakes around the world.


# How to use this repository

You'll build Quake Report in a series of exercises, each adding a small feature.

Each Exercise folder contains a README.md file explaining the state of the code and what the next steps are for the development of the app. Most importantly, the files will contain comments tagged with "TODO", that identify places that you'll need to add features to complete the exercise. Android studio provides a TODO pane at the bottom left of the window, so you can easily identify places you'll need to make changes.

Accompanying each exercise folder is a solution folder, which contains all the same TODOs, but with our answers filled in. If you get stuck on any particular TODO, you can use the solution folder to get back on track!


# Getting Started

If you're reading this file on GitHub, first you'll need to download the contents of this branch. You can do this by clicking the gray "Download ZIP" button at the top left of the file list above this text (of course, if you're familiar with GitHub)


# For Git Experts

Instead of downloading a zip

In addition to the `student` branch you're on right now this repository contains a branch corresponding to the state of the

` branch right now, but there are a bunch more branches in this repository. The `develop` branch contains a clean history of QuakeReport, with a single commit for each snapshot folder in the `student` branch. Note that this branch may be rebased at any time
